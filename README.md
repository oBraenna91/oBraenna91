### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ole-Aleksander Braenna!

I am currently a student of Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

I am studying Front-End Development - I started in October '21 and I'll finish in September '23!

My page will contain repositories for school projects, and currently I am only using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

For contact, please send me an e-mail at ole.braenna@gmail.com!
